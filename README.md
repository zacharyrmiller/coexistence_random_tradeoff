This repository includes:

cc_functions.R: core simulation functions for the competition-colonization trade-off model, including functions to find the coexisting set of species given an initial pool and to obtain equilibrium occupancies for all species (without numerical integration)

distribution_definitions.R: functions to sample from example probability distributions used throughout the study

paper_figures_code.R: code to reproduce all figures in the main text of the paper

supplement_figures_code.R: code to reproduce figures in the supplementary information
